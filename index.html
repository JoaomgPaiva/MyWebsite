        My name is João Paiva i was born in Almada - Portugal in 1997 and i have been a thinkerer since i was a little boy. I remember
        dismanteling my RC cars to use the pieces to make new ones and taking appart old apliances just to see how they worked.
        Through the years this enjoyment in creating things has led me to my three greatest passions, programming, robotics
        and 3D printing and i´ve been building my life around it since then, from my educational history to my career i've always tried to make it
        revolved around one of this three subjects.
      </p>
      <p class="mid-p">
        At the age of 15 i made a decision that would change my life for the better, i would start studying so that i could do
        what i loved and with that in mind i went to <a class="atec" href="https://www.atec.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atec - academia de formação</a>
        and enrolled on the course of Eletronics, Automation and Command from whom i have graduated in 2016, after that i would enroll on the complementary
        especialization course Robotics, Automation and Industrial Control where i had the chance to compete in the WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017
        in the profession on mobile robotics.
      </p>
      <p class="mid-p">
        From that moment on i have had the pleasure to work in several companies like Siemens, Visteon, Hanon, SMP and Volkswagen Autoeuropa as
        a manutention technitian, quality control technitian, operation technitian and troubleshooting technitian.
      </p>
      <p class="mid-p">
        In 2019 i realized that one of my greatest joys in life is learning and have enrolled in several courses since then in areas
        like game development, 3D modeling, 3D printing, web development and Networking.
